                     <p>
                        In 2011, MythCoders founder Justin Adkins was in his bedroom in Somerset, OH working on Windows Phone apps.
                        Back then, things were published under the name Adkins Software Development.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Later on, Justin decided the company needed a shorter and catchier name.
                        After taking mythology at Sheridan High School he maintained a strong fascination with Greek Gods and Goddesses;
                        Since he had already adopted the practice of giving projects codenames (such as Athena and Aphrodite) he
                        embraced his inner nerd.
                     </p>
                     <p>With that, MythCoders was born!</p>
                     <p>
                        Over the next year, MythCoders began offering website design and development for our local clients.
                        We even expanded into the central Ohio region!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Since then, we've worked hard to offer a wide variety of technical products and solutions that
                        are easy to use. We pride ourselves on our prices and solutions that are specifically designed with our
                        client's budget in mind.
